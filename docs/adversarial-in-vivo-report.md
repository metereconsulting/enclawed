# In-vivo adversarial F1-F4 comparison (real backends)

Generated: 2026-05-02T05:00:14.133Z (Node v22.11.0, linux/x64).

Per category, an adversarial agent fires the four biconditional failure modes from paper §5 against a real backend, inside a safety envelope (sandboxed dir, hard wall-clock + API-call budgets, hostname allowlist, cleanup on completion). Each scenario is then scored against three subjects: OpenClaw upstream, enclawed-oss, enclawed-enclaved.

## Headline

|---|---:|---:|
| OpenClaw (upstream) | 0 / 36 | 0.0% |

## Safety envelope

Every adversarial agent runs inside `enclawed/test/security/in-vivo/safety.mjs`'s `withSafeEnvelope`, which enforces:

- Hard wall-clock budget per scenario (default 30 s, hard ceiling 300 s).
- Hard API-call cap per scenario (default 5 calls, hard ceiling 20).
- Hard byte caps in/out per scenario.
- Sandboxed scratch directory; cleaned up on success and on safety abort.
- Hostname allowlist per agent (e.g. discord agent only allows `discord.com`).
- Test-resource fence: every cloud target ID (Discord guild, Telegram chat, ...) must be declared in a `ENCLAWED_INVIVO_*` env var. The harness does not pick up your normal openclaw/enclawed credentials by accident.

If any guard trips, the agent run aborts and the per-scenario row reads `safety` with the trip code. The harness keeps going to the next scenario.

## Total harness time

15397.6 ms across 36 scenarios over 9 categories. 0 categories were skipped for missing env vars.
