# Per-extension adversarial F1-F4 comparison

OpenClaw (upstream) vs enclawed-oss vs enclawed-enclaved, with **per-extension scenarios**: each extension's F1-F4 inputs are derived from that extension's own manifest, so a Discord extension is probed against `(publish, channel://discord/message)`, an Ollama extension against `(tool.invoke, provider://ollama/inference)`, a browser extension against `(tool.invoke, tool://browser/op)`, etc. Same biconditional checker, but the (cap, target) pair under test is unique to each row.

## Roles found across the catalog

Each extension is classified into a role based on its manifest, and the F1-F4 scenarios for that row use a (cap, target) tuple consistent with that role:

| Role | Sample (cap, target) pattern | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| `channel` | `(publish, channel://bluebubbles/message)` | 23 |
| `declared` | `(skill, acpx://op)` | 28 |
| `generic` | `(tool.invoke, tool://alibaba/op)` | 28 |
| `provider` | `(tool.invoke, provider://amazon-bedrock/inference)` | 49 |
| `tool` | `(tool.invoke, tool://browser/browser)` | 4 |
| `utility` | `(-, -)` | 2 |

## Per-extension scoreboard

Each row probes the named extension on its OWN (cap, target). `OC` = OpenClaw upstream, `OSS` = enclawed-oss, `ENC` = enclawed-enclaved. `–` = extension not present in that tree.

## Failure-mode primer (with per-extension grounding)

For an extension X with manifest-derived `(capX, targetX)`:

- **F1 gate-bypass.** Corpus delta = `[{op: capX, target: targetX, count: 1}]`; audit = `[]`. The extension mutated its own surface without going through the admission gate.
- **F2 audit-forgery.** Audit = `[{type: irreversible.executed, payload: {ok:true, call:{cap:capX, target:targetX}}}]`; corpus = `[]`. Audit claims X did the work, but no corpus mutation exists.
- **F3 approved-but-failed-silent.** Audit `ok=false` for `(capX, targetX)` (excluded from `S`); corpus shows the mutation. Projects as F1 because `S` excludes `ok=false`.
- **F4 wrong-target.** Audit approved `(capX, targetX)` but corpus mutated `(capX, attacker-target)`. Both halves of the multiset differ, surfacing as F1 + F2.

## Methodology

1. **Tree probe.** Walk every `*.ts/.tsx/.mjs/.js/.cjs` file in each tree (skipping node_modules, dist, build) and grep for the canonical symbol of each detection primitive. Probe terminates early once every primitive has been located.
2. **Per-extension manifest derivation.** For each extension directory, read its manifest -- `enclawed.module.json` if signed (enclawed side), else `openclaw.plugin.json` (openclaw side), else fall back to `package.json`. Derive the extension's role (channel / provider / tool / etc.) and a canonical `(cap, target)` tuple consistent with that role.
3. **Per-extension F1-F4 scenarios.** Build the four failure-mode scenarios using the extension's OWN `(cap, target)` so each row exercises that extension's specific capability surface.
4. **Detection.** A scenario is detected iff (a) the subject's tree carries every primitive that scenario depends on AND (b) the in-memory biconditional checker (mirrored from `src/enclawed/biconditional.ts`) returns a non-ok report on the (delta, audit) pair.
5. **Reproduce.** `node enclawed/test/security/adversarial-comparison.harness.mjs`. Override the upstream / companion paths with `OPENCLAW_PATH`, `ENCLAWED_OSS_PATH`, `ENCLAWED_ENCLAVED_PATH`. Dependency-free; runs on stock Node 22+.

## What this proves

- Every OpenClaw extension's adversarial F1-F4 scenarios go undetected because the upstream tree contains zero detection primitives that could surface a (delta, audit) mismatch -- regardless of which capability the extension exposes.
- Every enclawed-oss extension's adversarial F1-F4 scenarios are detected by the inherited biconditional checker, on (cap, target) pairs derived from each extension's OWN manifest -- not a synthetic constant.
- enclawed-enclaved adds the bootstrap seal which blocks unsigned/under-verified extensions at admission time, so the same attacks never reach the corpus. The OSS biconditional checker stays in place as a post-hoc fallback.
- Stated as a comparison: across the **124** OpenClaw extensions probed, OpenClaw's framework caught **0** / 496 (rate **0.0%**); across the **124** enclawed-oss extensions probed, enclawed-oss caught **496** / 496 (rate **100.0%**); across the **132** enclawed-enclaved extensions probed, enclawed-enclaved caught **528** / 528 (rate **100.0%**).
